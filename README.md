# A simple score classifier

A simple implementation of a naive Bayes binary classifier particularly well suited
for count/categorical predictors.

This implementation is build on top of the sklearn library which makes able to
implement it in work pipelines and other related useful features that the 
library provides.

For a better undetstanding about how this technique is used, please refer to the
development.rst file.

For a demostration about how the library is used please refer to the examply.ipynb
notebook.
